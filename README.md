# analyzing-the-sales-data-of-an-e-commerce-platform-using-BigQuery
Explored columnar databases by implementing data warehouse solutions by analyzing the sales data of an e-commerce platform stored in BigQuery to gain insights into product performance.

Took e-commerce dataset from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/-women-clothing-ecommerce-sales-data

Used BigQuery as it is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse provided by Google Cloud. It stores data in a columnar format, making it well-suited for analytical workloads.

Step 1: Uploaded csv in Google Cloud Storage.
Step 2: Created BigQuery dataset as ‘ecommerce_dataset’ and loaded the csv uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.
Step 3: Created table as ecommerce and inserted values from storage to table.
